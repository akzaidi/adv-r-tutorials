    "## Overview \n",
    "### Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this session, you will have learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Take advantage of the verbs and syntax you learned from the `dplyr` module to manipulate `RxXdfData` data objects\n",
    "* Summarize your `RxXdfData` objects quickly and easily\n",
    "* Create custom functions and use them for mutations and summarizations\n",
    "* Understand where and when to use the `dplyrXdf` package and when to use functions from the `RevoScaleR` package\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why dplyrXdf?\n",
    "### Simplify Your Analysis Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `RevoScaleR` package enables R users to manipulate data that is larger than memory\n",
    "* It introduces a new data type, called an `xdf` (short for eXternal Data Frame), which are highly efficient out-of-memory objects\n",
    "* However, many of the `RevoScaleR` functions have a dramatically different syntax from base R functions\n",
    "* The `dplyr` package has becme exceptionally popular, due to its appealing syntax, and since it's extensible, we have created a new package called `dplyrXdf` that exposes most of the `dplyr` functionality to `xdf` objects\n",
    "* Many data analysis pipelines require creating many intermediate datasets, which are only needed for their role in deriving a final dataset, but have no/little use on their own\n",
    "* The `dplyrXdf` abstracts this task of file management, so that you can focus on the data itself, rather than the management of intermediate files\n",
    "* Unlike `dplyr`, or other base R packages, `dplyrXdf` allows you to work with data residing _outside_ of memory, and therefore scales to datasets of arbitrary size\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements \n",
    "### What You'll Need\n",
    "\n",
    "* I expect that you have already covered the `dplyr` training\n",
    "* Understand the *XDF* data type and how to import data to *XDF*\n",
    "* If you're working on a different computer than your trianer: have (`devtools`)[github.com/hadley/devtools] (and if on a Windows machine, [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/))\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing dplyrXdf\n",
    "\n",
    "* The `dplyrXdf` package is not yet on CRAN\n",
    "* You have to download it from [github](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/dplyrXdf/)\n",
    "  - if you're on a windows machine, install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) as well\n",
    "  - the `devtools` package provides a very handy function, `install_github`, for installing R packages saved in github repositories\n",
